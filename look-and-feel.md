# General

    -(DONE) Examine alternate fonts/font sizes
        -Decided against
    -(DONE) Icons for sections in side menu
    -(DONE) Add login/logout button to side menu
    -(DONE) Ensure app looks correct on larger and smaller screens (within reason)
    -Gonna need an app icon at some point
        -Probably the last thing to worry about
    -(DONE-ish) Ensure app utilizes proper stylistic conventions for IOS and Android
        -In particular, ensure IOS buttons are properly styled and distinguishable
            -React-Native seems to naturally adhere to most stylistic conventions, but a visual pass on IOS is still needed

# Timer Screen

    -(DONE) Consider use of drop shadow for elements
        -Against Apple style guide
    -(DONE) Consider creating border for controls
        -Unnecessary and it would be a tight squeeze on smaller screens
    -(DONE) Remove placeholder text from timer alerts
    -(DONE) Task Modal
        -(DONE) Dividers between tasks in Task modal?
            -Revist later to ensure suitability
        -(DONE) Ensure task editing interface is intuitive enough (better placeholder text?)
            -Seems good
        -(DONE) Ensure use of proper keyboard avoiding views/etc
        -(DONE) Show a loading spinner after adding tasks on cloud, or figure out how to make them show up faster
            -Decided against; it would end up being busy and cluttered and not actually any more responsive
        -(DONE) Ensure user cannot enter blank tasks

# Preferences Screen

    -(DONE) Adjust spacing between items
    -(DONE) Remove logout and cloud buttons
    -(DONE) Ensure only proper inputs can be entered into option fields
    -(DONE) Ensure option fields are properly readable (place initial values inside, not placeholders)
    -(DONE) Clear unsaved fields whenever user navigates away
    -(DONE) Dividers between options?
        -Nah.
    -(DONE) Check out other option screens and identify best practices
        -The minimalism look is good
